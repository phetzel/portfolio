										<h2>A quick bio</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I am a native of the east bay area who loves 
										nature, eating as many different types of amazing 
										foods as possible, and of lately coding! I 
										have spent the majority of the last decade 
										working various jobs, primarily in the service industry,
										where, while I am very grateful for all my employers
										 and the lovely people who I have met, I had started to
										 feel unchallenged and complacent. A few years ago 
										 I discovered coding, where learning how to build things
										 made me excited again!
									 </p>
									 <p>I finally decided to go all in on coding and 
										 have spent the last 6 months sharpining my skills.
										I graduated the App ACademy boot camp in 2020, and am finally
										in a place where I feel comfortable about puting 
										myself out there. I am a hardworking, optimistic employee,
										who is used to working with a team to do whatever it takes
										 to make a buisness successful.
									</p>
									<p>Thanks for taking the time to check me out!</p>
